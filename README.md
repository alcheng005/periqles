# periqles
A component library that makes creating forms to commit mutations in a React-Relay codebase easy, fast, and DRY. Periqles introspects the project's schema and intuits the input fields, data types, and optimal UI for a given mutation, abstracting away the UI and API calls needed to collect user input so that you can be free to focus on the business logic of your application.
